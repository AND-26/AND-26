# Hi, I'm Andrew! 👋
- I am frontend web developer doing all things creative to make the web a more unique and awesome place.
- Music, anime, basketball and program are my happy places
- I enjoy bringing a static design or idea to life and learning new technologies.


## 🚀 About Me
I was born in Colombia, but I came to Spain when I was 5 years old, it was not difficult for me to get used to a new country, a new city, customs, gastronomy, culture, etc., since I quickly adapt to the circumstances that arise.

I have always opted for technology, specifically web development. I have taken courses in the Madrid community on HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript to see what this world offered me and the truth is that it has been very positive.

Thanks to the circumstances that I have had lately, I have not only been able to delve into the technologies (HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript) but I have also been able to learn a library called React and thanks to this I already know what I want to specialize in. my life that is to be:
Front-End Developer more specifically in React.

This gigantic world has not only allowed me to be a web developer, but thanks to this I have been able to meet people who know a lot about these technologies and others and who encourage me to continue improving in what I want to dedicate myself to.

If you want and have time, send me a message and we not only share experience in the code but also a good chat.

All the best.
